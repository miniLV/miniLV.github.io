Background: While slacking off at work recently, a random thought popped into my head — how much money have I actually earned sitting here right now? Not the paycheck kind, but real-time. Like, it's 2:32 PM, how much have I made today? Enough for a bubble tea? It seemed fun, so I built a little tool. One thing led to another — wishlist, overtime alerts, privacy mode — and suddenly I'd created more work for myself while trying to slack off.

## About Vibe Coding

This project is special — it's my first **100% Vibe Coding** experiment.

What does that mean? From start to finish, the code was basically written by AI. My job was to provide requirements, review, and steer the direction. The UI was also auto-generated by Figma AI — I just tweaked some details. The whole process was pretty smooth, and definitely more efficient than before.

Of course, you can't completely turn off your brain. You still need to review carefully, or AI might introduce some bugs. But overall, this development approach is worth trying.

| *Real-time earnings* | *Hidden numbers* | *Time to go home* |

The visual style is cyberpunk — neon green as the main color, CRT scanline effects, occasional glitch aesthetics. A bit edgy, I know, but I dig it~

## Final Thoughts

Let's be honest — work is just trading time for money. Nothing romantic about it. Boss pays, I work. Fair deal.

But here's the thing: work is just part of life, not all of it. When it's time to leave, leave. Rest when you need to. Play when you want to. Set a small goal — save enough for a nice meal, a new phone, a spontaneous trip.

The purpose of this tool is simple: **Know how much your time is worth, then clock out on time and live your life.**

Stop grinding yourself to death. Seriously. Your health is yours. Your life is yours.
